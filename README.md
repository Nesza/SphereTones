# SphereTones

SphereTones is a visual instrument. In contrast to traditional composition methods this approach places intuition, randomness, playfulness in the focus of attention.

The body of the instrument is the interface itself. The graphic is minimalistic and 100% functional. Here every line has a meaning. What you can see you can hear and it is true for the other way around as well. The interface is the fusion of sound and image. The system organically changes as the user plays, it balances between order and chaos.
